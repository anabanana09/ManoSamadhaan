# ManoSamadhaan

GitHub Repository Description for ManoSamadhaan


ManoSamadhaan is a dual-platform application designed to innovate mental health diagnostics and enhance the interaction between patients and healthcare providers. This repository contains the codebase for a comprehensive solution that utilizes machine learning algorithms and digital communication tools to predict mental health conditions and facilitate effective patient-doctor engagement.

Key Features:

Predictive Analysis: Integrates XGBoost to analyze responses from mental health questionnaires and predict potential conditions. The predictive outcomes help tailor the clinical approach without revealing sensitive diagnostics directly to patients, maintaining ethical standards.
CBT and Dietary Recommendations: Automatically provides cognitive behavioral therapy guidance and dietary suggestions based on the preliminary diagnosis, empowering patients with immediate, actionable health strategies.
Secure Doctor-Patient Communication: Features a secure messaging system within the app that allows for real-time, confidential communication between patients and doctors.
Data Privacy and Security: Ensures top-level data protection and privacy compliance, safeguarding personal and sensitive user information.
Accessible Healthcare: Aims to reduce barriers to mental health services, especially in underserved areas, by leveraging technology to provide remote assessments and consultations.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Web) and React Native (Mobile)
Backend: Flask for API development, handling requests, and serving the machine learning model.
Database: PostgreSQL for robust data management.
Machine Learning: Python with XGBoost and Scikit-Learn for predictive modeling.
Additional Tools: Docker for deployment, Heroku for cloud hosting, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.
Getting Started:
